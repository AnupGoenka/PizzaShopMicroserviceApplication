This Application is a work in progress. Most of the functionallity of the backend APIs are completed, but frontend is in it's infantcy. 

If you decide to clone and build it, be aware that if you view the frontend, the menu page will look blank except for the nav bar initiialy. This is becasue the database is initiallized without any data. To fix, either create menus and menu items by making api calls to the menu microservice or sql calls to the database, or log in to the frontend site as admin by checking the isAdmin option. Then you can create menus and menu items from the menu page.
